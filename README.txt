# Task 
In case I misunderstood the task in any way, and you want me to code it as a regular shopify section, 
please let me know, and I will quickly transform it and send you the store url. 
( Whether the transfer hours will count in overall task completion time or not, it's up to you. 
I will let you know how much time I needed, but I won't log it )

# Images 
On pexels.com I found a few similar images to use them for slider.
After cropping and resizing, I used tinyjpg to optimize their size.

# Layout
I will use grid (mainly for basic overall layout mobile version and grid templates areas)...
For positioning - flexbox

# Slider
I will use Swiper.js and modify the mouseover behavior
